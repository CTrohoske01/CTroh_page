    <title>Shrewsberry Cake</title>

    <desc>Shrewsberry/Shrewsbury cakes are a kind of biscuit. They are less crumbly than a
        shortbread but have a buttery flavour. Sweet foods like biscuits were popular with the
        Georgians and were easier to make because of the the increased importing of sugar from the
        sugar plantations in the Caribbean. They were made to accompany many dishes but were popular
        with syllabub, which is a sugared, whipped cream, flavoured with cider or sherry. Sugar was
        an important trade item and refined (white) sugar was very fashionable.</desc>

    <p>This recipe uses white sugar, which would have been pinched off a sugarloaf and then ground
        (beaten) until fine enough to use in the recipe.</p>

    <p>Traditionally they are baked as thick, large biscuits and were able to be kept for long
        periods of time.</p>

    <p>This recipe comes from A delightful Daily Exercise for Ladies and
        Gentlewomen</p>

    <quote>"Take a quart of very fine flouwer, eight onces of fine sugar beaten and cersed, twelve
        ounces sweet butter, nutmeg grated, damaske rosewater- work together with your hands for
        halfe an houre, then roule in little round cakes about the thickness of three shillings,
        then take a glasse and cut the cakes, then strow some flower on white papers and bake them
        in an oven as hotte as for manchet. If the oven be not hotte sett your lid downe ( there is
        a long explanantion for testing/changing the heat in the period oven which i have omitted)
        until they be baked enough, for they must lokke browne not white. you may keep them halfe a
        yeare but new baked are best."</quote>
